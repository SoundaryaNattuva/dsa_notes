// DFS recursive pseudocode

/*

DFS(vertex):
  if vertex is empty
    return (this is base case)
  add vertex to results list
  mark vertex as visited
  for each neighbor in vertex's neighbors:
    if neighbor is not visited:
      recursively call DFS on neighbor

Visiting things:
{
  "A": true,
  "B": true,
  "D": true,
}
